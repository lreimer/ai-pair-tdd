description: 'List my Github issues in the current repository'
---

Search the current repo (using #githubRepo for the repo info) and list any issues you find (using #github/list_issues) that are assigned to me (using #github/get_me).

Suggest issues that I might want to focus on based on their age, the amount of comments, and their status (open/closed).
